ü•¶ ü•¨ üçó ü•© üçñ ü•í

the factory is supposed to pack all the meat ingredients into one array and the vegetables into one

This is how the arrays usually look like!

let meatArr = ["beef","chicken","rabbit"]
let vegetableArr = ["carrots","potatoes","lettuce"]
Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
and currently it looks like this now!

let meatArr = ["beef","chicken"]
let vegetableArr = ["rabbit","carrots","potatoes","lettuce"]
Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
using the Spread operator , make sure all the ingredients are in the correct spot
