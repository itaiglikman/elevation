<!-- Exercise 3 - Visual Overload
- Create the following (hover over the boxes), using the guidelines below:

The rule is simple: when you hover your mouse over any box, that box should change to a random color.

You should only have one div inside your index.html body - a div with an ID of container, which will hold all the boxes
Generate and add the other boxes to container using JS (you should be using a for loop)
In the loop, you should first create a box, then give it its attributes
To make each box respond to its own onmouseenter event, you can use the same box you created in the beginning in order to change its background color (alternatively, you can use JS this)
Except for the background colors, the CSS should be in a separate file -->
